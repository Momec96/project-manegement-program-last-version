 I designed and implemented a Python program featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter that optimally allocates tasks to individuals based on their skills and availability. This program addresses the crucial objective of maximizing productivity by intelligently assigning tasks to the most suitable personnel. Additionally, I integrated a database using SQL, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of relevant data. One special feature of the program is that it divides users into groups according to ratings or ability levels, therefore making it even more effective at optimizing work assignments and increasing team productivity.
